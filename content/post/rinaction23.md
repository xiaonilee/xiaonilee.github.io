Notebook of Reading Books: R in Action_Chapter 23.

<!--more-->

## This chapter covers

- An introduction to the lattice package

- Grouping and conditioning

- Adding information with panel functions

- Customizing a lattice graphâ€™s appearance

### 23.1. The lattice package

- Figure 23.1. Trellis graph of singer heights by voice part.

  ![fig231](fig231.png)

- Table 23.1. Graph types and corresponding functions in the ***lattice*** package.

### 23.2. Conditioning variables

- Typically, conditioning variables are factors. 

- If It's a continuous variable:
  - `cut()`
  - **myshingle**

```r
myshingle <- equal.count(x, number=n, overlap=proportion)
```

- Figure 23.2. Trellis plot of miles per gallon vs. car weight conditioned on engine displacement.
  - engine displacement is a continuous variable
    - it has been converted to three non-overlapping shingles with equal numbers of observations.

### 23.3. Panel functions

- Figure 23.3. Trellis plot of miles per gallon vs. car weight conditioned on engine displacement. 
  - A custom panel function has been used to add regression lines, rug plots, and grid lines.

- Figure 23.4. Trellis graph of miles per gallon vs. engine displacement conditioned on transmission type. 
  - Smoothed lines (loess), grids, and group mean levels have been added.
