### 22.3. Creating dynamic reports with R and LaTeX

- LaTeX is powerful, But it requires significant study to use effectively and creates documents in formats (PDF, DVI, PS) that canâ€™t be edited.

- With the text file [**drugs.Rnw**](drugs.Rnw):
  - Processed through the `knit()` function.
    - Resulting in the output file: [drugs.tex](drugs.tex) and [figure](figure/unnamed-chunk-4-1.pdf).

      ![fig](fig.png)

  - Processed through the `knit2pdf()` function.
    - Resulting in a typeset PDF document ([drugs.pdf](drugs.pdf)).
