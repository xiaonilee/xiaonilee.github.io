The authors present `EpiMap`, a compendium comprising 10,000 epigenomic maps across 800 samples, which they used to define chromatin states, high-resolution enhancers, enhancer modules, upstream regulators and downstream target genes.

### Summary

- **Background**: Annotating the molecular basis of human disease remains an unsolved challenge, as ***93% of disease loci are non-coding*** and gene-regulatory annotations are highly incomplete.

- **Achiement**: EpiMap, a compendium comprising 10,000 epigenomic maps across 800 samples, which we used to define chromatin states, high-resolution enhancers, enhancer modules, upstream regulators and downstream target genes.

- **Signatures**: The results demonstrate the importance of dense, rich, high-resolution epigenomic annotations for the investigation of complex traits.

- **Methods and code available**:
