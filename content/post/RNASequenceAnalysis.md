**Google Colab** is a free service providing interactive computing resources via a user interface, runs on Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and provides free access to GPUs and TPUs.

**RNA sequence** is a technique that can examine the quantity and sequences of RNA in a sample using next generation sequencing (NGS). It analyzes the ***transcriptome*** of gene expression patterns encoded within our RNA.
