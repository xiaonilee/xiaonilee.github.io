The present study assessed the correlation between **PITX1** expression and the prognostic factor of **breast cancer** by using various online analysis databases to explore the prognostic significance of PITX1 gene in the treatment of breast cancer.

Herein, I will recover all figures for this paper step by step.

## In Brief for this paper
- **Publication** 
  - [**Biosci Rep.** 2020 Sep 30; 40(9): BSR20202537](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7494990/)

- **Keywords**
  - PITX1 gene
  - breast cancer

- **Methods**
  - `Oncomine`
  - `Bc-GenExMiner v4.3`
  - `PrognoScan`
  - `UCSC xena`

### Figure 1. Expression of PITX1 gene in 20 common tumors compared with paired normal tissues

- Methods: Oncomine

- Open [Oncomine database](https://www.oncomine.org/resource/main.html).
- Enter `PITX1` to search and get figure 1.

### Figure 2. Box plots of normal and tumor differentially expression of PITX1 gene in different subtypes of breast cancer

- Methods: Oncomine

- Setup parameters and get the data for figure 2A.
